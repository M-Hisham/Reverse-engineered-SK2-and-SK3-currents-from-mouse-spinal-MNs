# Reverse-engineered-SK2-and-SK3-currents-from-mouse-spinal-MNs
This repository contain project files about reverse-engineered SK2 SK3 kinetics from electrophysiological recordings of mouse spinal motoneurons.

the files assist in running the simulations published in the modeling study entitled <b><i>“Reverse-engineering SK2 and SK3 currents from the electrophysiological recordings of mouse spinal motoneurons”</i></b> by Mohamed H. Mousa, Christiana S.I. Draper, Amr A. Mahrous, and Sherif M. Elbasiouny.

## Platform:
* Files run on [NEURON simulator](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/what_is_neuron), after compilation

## What is included in the mod file:
deterministic ion channels in Hodgkin-Huxley form + calcium dynamics in the motor neurons soma
### Channels:
* SK2 (Calcium activated potassium channel isoform K<sub>Ca</sub>2.2)
* SK3 (Calcium activated potassium channel isoform K<sub>Ca</sub>2.3)
* N-type calcium channel
* L-type calcium channel
